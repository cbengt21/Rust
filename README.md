# Rust
Learning Rust, https://www.rust-lang.org/

This is were my main reading starts:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/index.htm

- compile apps by "rustc file_name.rs" or optionally add your own name by "rustc file_name.rs -o exe_name"
- run app by "./exe_name"

Generating a new project (https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started):
"cargo new 'project_name'"

Running project:
"cargo run"
