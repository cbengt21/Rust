# revised: When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the versions 
# of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the Cargo.lock file. When 
# you build your project in the future, Cargo will see that the Cargo.lock file exists and 
# use the versions specified there rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions 
# again. This lets you have a reproducible build automatically.
